name: "Mission Possible\" Role-Play Board Game for Entrepreneurial Thinking & Impact"
summary: Mission Possible is an interactive role-play simulation board game where students take on startup roles and navigate real-world sustainability, digital, and ethical dilemmas. Aligned with EntreComp, GreenComp, and DigiComp, it turns classrooms into entrepreneurial adventure labs.
description: |
  Mission Possible is a printable or digital board-game-style resource for university-level entrepreneurship classes. Students are split into small startup teams and assigned a fictional mission (e.g. launch a green app, solve a food waste problem). As they progress, they encounter cards presenting real-life challenges like:
  Choosing between profit and ethics,
  Dealing with team conflict,
  Deciding whether to use generative AI tools, etc.
outcomes: |
  Improved ability to handle entrepreneurial uncertainty
  Greater understanding of how ethics, sustainability, and digitalization interact in entrepreneurship
  Strengthened collaborative and reflective learning
instructions: |
  1.	Form startup teams (3–5 students)
  2.	Assign each group a Mission Card (e.g. “You are building an AI-based recycling app for Gen Z users.”)
  3.	Distribute role cards randomly to each member of the team. 
  4.	Each round, teams roll the dice and move their token forward on the Mission Possible board. If they land on a space marked with a thematic icon, they must draw a Challenge Card from the corresponding deck.
  5.	Teams draw Challenge Cards from 3 thematic decks:
  o	Digital dilemmas (DigiComp)
  o	Green & social impact issues (GreenComp)
  o	Business strategy decisions (EntreComp)
  6.	Teams read the card aloud and discuss for 10 minutes which decision to take — considering their roles and mission.
  7.	Once the team reaches the END, they pitch how they navigated their journey
  8.	Educator leads guided reflection using the Team Reflection Sheet
