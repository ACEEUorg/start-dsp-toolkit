instructions: |
  1.	Open the tool and analyze the concepts and sections, do any or most of them seem familiar to you? ¿Did you know the interest rates?
  2.	Enter the amount of money that, hypothetically, you would need for your business idea. It is always advisable to put a slightly higher amount than calculated in case there are cost overruns, but no more than 5 or 10%.
  3.	Enter the interest rate and other fees charged by the bank. You can do a simulation and go to the interest page of a bank you know, in the business section, what rates do they offer for businesses, if you do not find the information, you can ask an AI what is the interest rate that banks usually give in the region where you live.
  4.	With your teacher and colleagues, analyze the figure obtained and decide whether or not to purchase the loan based on the other financial projections. If after a few years the money is too high or you think you won't be able to cover the dues with sales, it may not be the best idea for you.
