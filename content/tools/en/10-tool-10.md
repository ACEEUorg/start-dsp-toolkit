summary: Designed for faculty, finance staff, and innovation teams, this tool helps universities identify, track, and plan financial investments in entrepreneurship education to support data-informed strategic decisions.
description: Planning and Financing of Entrepreneurship Education is a ready-to-use template for faculty, finance teams, and innovation staff. It offers a structured way to collect and analyse data on financial investments in entrepreneurship education across faculties and departments. The tool supports improved planning, highlights gaps or inefficiencies, and helps align resources with the university’s strategic entrepreneurship goals.
outcomes: Using this template, universities can develop a clear, data-informed overview of how much is currently being invested in entrepreneurship education. It helps identify where resources are missing, duplicated, or under-used, enabling more effective alignment with strategic goals. The process supports stronger planning and prioritisation by providing reliable financial insights. It also improves transparency and accountability, allowing institutions to demonstrate the value of their entrepreneurship efforts to leadership and stakeholders. Over time, this tool can serve as the foundation for more consistent tracking and better-informed funding decisions.
instructions: |
  This is a template that universities or organisations can adapt and remake to suit their own context. The steps below guide users through collecting and using financial data to inform strategic planning.
  1. Distribute the Survey
  Share the Google Form survey link with key representatives from faculties such as Business, Engineering, Social Sciences, Science, and departments including Finance and Entrepreneurship Centres.
  2. Request Qualitative and Quantitative Input
  Ask each respondent to provide both financial data (e.g. budgets, spending figures) and qualitative insights on how entrepreneurship-related funds are used.
  3. Gather and Consolidate Responses
  Use Google Forms to automatically collect input. Export the responses for further analysis or review key trends using built-in reporting features.
  4. Generate Initial Findings
  Identify overall investment levels, primary funding sources, and how funds are allocated across departments. Note any missing data or unclear spending.
  5. Identify Strategic Opportunities
  Spot underfunded areas (e.g. incubators or student startup support) and compare departmental investment levels against overall entrepreneurship education goals.
  6. Report and Recommend Actions
  Present your findings to leadership. Use the insights to suggest improvements in resource distribution or to embed regular financial tracking into university planning processes.
